    "\n",
    " * Deep Learning for Computer Vision – Winter Term 2025/26\n",
    " * Lecture by: Constantin Pape\n",
    " * Organizers: Anwai Archit, Sushmita Nair\n",
    " * Tutors: Azhar Akhmetova, Benjamin Eckhardt, Carolin Teuber, Luca Freckmann, Marei Freitag, Oleg Bakumenko, Sarah Muth\n",
    " * Due date: **Tuesday, Dec 9, before 10:00**\n",
    "## Time Required to Solve this Exercise Sheet\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will train deep CNNs on this exercise sheet, model training will require an increased amount of time. So we recommend to start working on this sheet early.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topic\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will solve an image classification task from medical imaging: classification in Chest X-Ray images into patients with Covid-19, Pneunomia or Healthy. We will use a subset of the dataset from a Kaggle challenge for this. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prashant268/chest-xray-covid19-pneumonia)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main focus of this exercise is transfer learning and you will approach the classification task with three different approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Training ResNets from scratch. (Note that we will use the ResNet implementation from torchvision throughout the exercise).\n",
    "    Training ResNets pretrained on ImageNet.\n",
    "    Training ResNets pretrained on RadImageNet, a large radiology dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition you can combine these approaches with other methods to improve the model at the end and upload your best solution on a hold-out test set. This is explained in more details at the end of the exercise."

    "### Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of the exercise you will train ResNets from scratch, analyze the effects of deeper models with small training data and use data augmentations. In the second part, you will solve the same task using pretrained ResNets (from ImageNet - pretrained on natural images; and RadImageNet - pretrained on the medical imaging domain).\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the background of this exercise, you can:\n",
    "- Review the lectures\n",
    "    - Lecture 3 on CNNs\n",
    "    - Lecture 4 on Transfer Learning and Augmentaion\n",
    "- Check out the [RadImageNet publication](https://doi.org/10.1148/ryai.210315).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the exercise you should further improve your model. You can draw upon a number of techniques we discussed for improving model performance. The predictions from your best model on a hold-out test set should be uploaded together with the exercise. More explanation is given at the end of the exercise sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Do not hesitate to ask questions and ideally discuss them with the fellow students on Matrix! We will monitor the channel to provide you help if your discussions get stuck._"
